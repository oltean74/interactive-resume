###Interactive resume
  All right, it's true...I have a great imagination!
  Whith some 'handy' scripts you can make the difference;
 
  I've coded a script for building scenario called "ioan_cv.js" and other one, coded by me years ago, and modified for this project, "panorama.js".

  Locations of animated bunny (I like to name that "stations") are automatically identified by script from 'area coords' html code;so, all
you have to do it's to build scenario with dialogs...and animate, of course!

   Thanks!
